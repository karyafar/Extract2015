#<a name="abstract"></a>Talk Abstract
Personalization is the key to the future of marketing in e-commerce. Extracting meaningful information from the data sources is the first step in building learning models that are used to craft a personalized experience in Etsy.  Etsy is an online market place for artisans selling unique handcrafted goods, and vintage wares. Kamelia is a data scientist in Etsy for the past two years. In this talk, sheâ€™ll discuss data extraction and machine learning techniques behind user, shop and listing recommendations that create a personalized experience for Etsy users!
